## Workbench

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

It allows you to capture thinking from whatever you're currently looking at into a "Workbench" note. Link and embed pages, headers, and blocks, or copy the current line. You can also use alt+click and cmd/windows+alt+click to add content to the workbench.

Demo:


### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js` and `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/workbench-obsidian/`.
